# Cline Rules: Phone Numbers Segmentation Web Application

## Project Patterns

### Coding Standards

- PHP code follows PSR-12 coding standards
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Document classes and methods with PHPDoc comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Architecture Patterns

- Follow three-layer architecture (presentation, business, data)
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Implement service classes for business logic
- Keep controllers thin, delegating to services

### File Organization

- Models in `src/Models/`
- Services in `src/Services/`
- Controllers in `src/Controllers/`
- Repositories in `src/Repositories/`
- Templates in `public/templates/`
- Static assets in `public/assets/`
- Tests mirror the src structure in `tests/`

## User Preferences

### Development Workflow

- Use Git for version control
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Document changes in memory bank after significant updates
- Keep track of progress in progress.md

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use mermaid diagrams for visualizing architecture and flows

## Implementation Notes

### Phone Number Segmentation

#### Technical Segmentation

- Focus specifically on Côte d'Ivoire phone numbers
- Support three formats:
  - International format with + prefix: +2250777104936
  - International format with 00 prefix: 002250777104936
  - Local format: 0777104936
- Standardize all formats internally for consistent processing
- Extract technical segments such as:
  - Country code (225 for Côte d'Ivoire)
  - Operator code (e.g., 07 for certain mobile operators)
  - Subscriber number
  - Operator name (derived from operator code)
- Validation should check for valid Ivorian phone number formats

#### Business Segmentation

- Support custom business-oriented segments for grouping phone numbers
- Allow creating and managing custom segments (e.g., by sector, company, client type)
- Implement many-to-many relationship between phone numbers and custom segments
- Support filtering and searching phone numbers by custom segments
- Provide API endpoints for managing custom segments and their associations

### Database Interactions

- Use prepared statements for all database queries
- Implement transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
- Keep database schema extensible to support both technical and business segmentation
- Use migrations for database schema changes
- Initialize database with sample custom segments

### Frontend Approach

- Use HTMX for AJAX requests and dynamic content
- Use Alpine.js for reactive components
- Keep JavaScript usage minimal and focused
- Ensure responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Provide intuitive interfaces for both technical and business segmentation

## Learning Journal

### Key Insights

- The project uses a combination of HTMX and Alpine.js to create a dynamic UI with minimal JavaScript
- SQLite provides a simple, file-based database solution that's perfect for this application
- The three-layer architecture ensures separation of concerns and maintainability
- Dual segmentation approach (technical and business) provides comprehensive phone number management

### Challenges to Watch

- Handling the three different Côte d'Ivoire phone number formats consistently
- Identifying and extracting operator information from Ivorian numbers
- Keeping up with any changes in Ivorian telecom numbering plans
- Balancing between simple UI and powerful functionality
- Ensuring performance with potentially complex segmentation algorithms
- Managing the many-to-many relationship between phone numbers and custom segments efficiently

### Evolution of Decisions

- SQLite was chosen for simplicity, but may need to evaluate if it meets performance needs as the application grows
- HTMX and Alpine.js were selected to minimize JavaScript while still providing dynamic UI capabilities
- The three-layer architecture was adopted to ensure clean separation of concerns
- Enhanced the database schema to support business-oriented segmentation for SMS campaigns
- Added custom segments to support business requirements for targeted SMS campaigns

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Development Tools

- Composer for PHP dependency management
- PHPUnit for testing
- Git for version control
- PHP's built-in server for local development

### Testing Approach

- Write unit tests for models, services, and repositories
- Use integration tests for testing interactions between components
- Manually test UI interactions
