# Product Context: Phone Numbers Segmentation Web Application

## Problem Statement

Phone numbers contain valuable information embedded within their structure, but this information is not readily apparent in their raw format. Organizations in Côte d'Ivoire dealing with large volumes of phone numbers need a way to extract and categorize this embedded information to gain insights, improve data organization, and enhance customer segmentation. Additionally, businesses need to group phone numbers by business criteria for targeted SMS campaigns.

## Solution

The Phone Numbers Segmentation Web Application provides a simple yet powerful tool to:

- Break down Côte d'Ivoire phone numbers into meaningful technical segments (country code, operator, etc.)
- Create custom business segments for grouping phone numbers (by sector, company, etc.)
- Support multiple phone number formats (international with + prefix, international with 00 prefix, and local format)
- Store and organize these segments for future reference and SMS campaigns
- Enable better data organization and analysis specific to Ivorian phone numbers

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity**: Users should be able to input phone numbers and receive segmentation results with minimal effort
- **Clarity**: Segmentation results should be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format
- **Efficiency**: The application should process phone numbers quickly and accurately
- **Flexibility**: Users should be able to manage (create, read, update, delete) phone numbers and their segments
- **Business Value**: The application should support business-oriented segmentation for targeted SMS campaigns

## Target Users

- Data analysts working with Ivorian customer information
- Marketing professionals segmenting Côte d'Ivoire customer bases

2. **Business Segmentation**: User creates custom segments and assigns phone numbers to these segments
3. **Batch Processing**: User uploads multiple phone numbers for segmentation and categorization
4. **Data Management**: User views, edits, or deletes previously segmented phone numbers
5. **Segment Management**: User creates, updates, or deletes custom segments for business purposes
6. **Segment-based Filtering**: User filters phone numbers by custom segments for targeted operations
7. **SMS Campaign Preparation**: User selects a segment to prepare for an SMS marketing campaign

## Segmentation Types

### Technical Segmentation

Technical segmentation extracts information embedded in the phone number structure:

- **Country Code**: The country code for Côte d'Ivoire (225)
- **Operator Code**: The code identifying the mobile operator (e.g., 07 for MTN)
- **Subscriber Number**: The unique number assigned to the subscriber
- **Operator Name**: The name of the mobile operator (e.g., MTN, Orange, Moov)

### Business Segmentation

Business segmentation groups phone numbers by business criteria:

- **Sector**: The business sector of the contact (e.g., healthcare, education, finance)
- **Company**: The company or organization the contact belongs to
- **Client Type**: The type of client (e.g., VIP, business, individual)
- **Custom Categories**: User-defined categories for specific business needs

This dual approach to segmentation allows for both technical analysis of phone numbers and business-oriented grouping for SMS campaigns and customer management.
