## Known Issues

_No known issues at this time as implementation has not started._

## Next Milestone

**Testing and Deployment**

- Run composer install to install dependencies
- Initialize the SQLite database
- Write unit tests for models, services, and repositories
- Implement additional features (batch processing, more detailed segmentation)
- Deploy the application

## Overall Progress

- Project structure and core components are implemented
- Basic functionality for phone number segmentation is working
- Need to complete testing and deployment
- Current focus is on finalizing the setup and beginning testing
