# Active Context: Phone Numbers Segmentation Web Application

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the implementation of the core components of the application. The project structure has been set up, and the functionality for segmenting Côte d'Ivoire phone numbers is working. The application can now handle the three specified formats (+225, 00225, and local) and extract segments such as country code, operator code, and subscriber number. We have also implemented business-oriented segmentation and SMS functionality to support SMS campaigns by segment.

## Recent Changes

- Set up the project structure with src/, public/, and tests/ directories
- Created the database schema and migration scripts
- Implemented the core models (PhoneNumber, Segment, CustomSegment)
- Implemented the repositories for data access
- Implemented the PhoneSegmentationService for phone number segmentation
- Created the PhoneController for handling HTTP requests
- Implemented the API endpoints for phone number operations
- Created a simple web interface using HTMX and Alpine.js
- Added batch processing functionality for multiple phone numbers
- Created a dedicated batch processing interface
- Improved navigation between different pages
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Enhanced the database schema to support business-oriented segmentation
- Added support for custom segments (e.g., by sector, company, etc.)
- Implemented API endpoints for managing custom segments
- Added sample custom segments for common business categories
- Implemented SMS functionality using the Orange API
- Created SMSService for sending SMS messages to individuals and segments
- Added SMSController with endpoints for SMS operations
- Created a user interface for sending SMS messages to segments
- Tested SMS functionality with the Orange API
- Set the sender name to "Qualitas CI" for all SMS messages

## Current Status

- Project structure and core components are implemented
- Technical segmentation functionality for phone numbers is working
- Business-oriented segmentation for SMS campaigns is implemented
- Batch processing functionality for multiple phone numbers is implemented
- Web interface for both individual and batch segmentation is available
- SMS functionality for sending messages to segments is implemented and tested
- API endpoints for CRUD, batch operations, segment management, and SMS operations are implemented
- GitHub repository is available at: https://github.com/workmusicalflow/phone-numbers-seg.git
- Dependencies installed and database initialized with sample segments
- Unit tests for models and services are passing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Expand Test Coverage**

   - Update unit tests for the new models and repositories
   - Write integration tests for repositories
   - Create end-to-end tests for the complete application flow
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling
   - Add tests for SMS functionality

2. **Documentation**

   - Add PHPDoc comments to the code
   - Create API documentation
   - Create a user guide with examples of business segmentation and SMS campaigns

3. **Additional Features**
   - Implement a user interface for managing custom segments
   - Enhance SMS campaign functionality with scheduling and templates
   - Implement user authentication for managing phone numbers and SMS campaigns
   - Add export functionality for segmentation results
   - Add SMS delivery tracking and reporting
   - Implement SMS campaign analytics and reporting

### Short-term Goals

1. **Additional Features**

   - Implement batch processing for multiple phone numbers
   - Add more detailed segmentation (e.g., region codes)
   - Implement user authentication for managing phone numbers

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Improve error handling and validation

3. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for production deployment
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy the application to a production server

## Active Decisions

- **Database Choice**: SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and file-based nature, making it easy to set up and use for this project.
- **Frontend Approach**: Using HTMX and Alpine.js to minimize JavaScript while still providing a dynamic user experience.
- **Architecture**: Three-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and testability.

## Open Questions

- What specific phone number segments will be extracted from Côte d'Ivoire numbers (e.g., operator identification, region codes)?
- Will there be any batch processing capabilities in the first version?
- Are there any specific performance requirements for the segmentation process?
- Are there any specific Ivorian telecom regulations that need to be considered?

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Handling edge cases in phone number formats and validation
- Keeping the operator mapping up-to-date with changes in the Ivorian telecom industry
- Optimizing the application for performance and scalability
