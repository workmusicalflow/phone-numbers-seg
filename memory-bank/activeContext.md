# Active Context: Phone Numbers Segmentation Web Application

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the core components of the application. The project structure has been set up, and the basic functionality for segmenting Côte d'Ivoire phone numbers is working. The application can now handle the three specified formats (+225, 00225, and local) and extract segments such as country code, operator code, and subscriber number.

## Recent Changes

- Set up the project structure with src/, public/, and tests/ directories
- Created the database schema and migration scripts
- Implemented the core models (PhoneNumber and Segment)
- Implemented the repositories for data access
- Implemented the PhoneSegmentationService for phone number segmentation
- Created the PhoneController for handling HTTP requests
- Implemented the API endpoints for phone number operations
- Created a simple web interface using HTMX and Alpine.js
- Added batch processing functionality for multiple phone numbers
- Created a dedicated batch processing interface
- Improved navigation between different pages
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all components

## Current Status

- Project structure and core components are implemented
- Basic functionality for phone number segmentation is working
- Batch processing functionality for multiple phone numbers is implemented
- Web interface for both individual and batch segmentation is available
- API endpoints for CRUD and batch operations are implemented
- GitHub repository is available at: https://github.com/workmusicalflow/phone-numbers-seg.git
- Dependencies installed and database initialized
- Unit tests for models and services are passing (18 tests with 79 assertions)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Expand Test Coverage**

   - Write integration tests for repositories
   - Create end-to-end tests for the complete application flow
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling

2. **Documentation**

   - Add PHPDoc comments to the code
   - Create API documentation
   - Create a user guide

3. **Additional Features**
   - Add more detailed segmentation (e.g., region codes)
   - Implement user authentication for managing phone numbers
   - Add export functionality for segmentation results

### Short-term Goals

1. **Additional Features**

   - Implement batch processing for multiple phone numbers
   - Add more detailed segmentation (e.g., region codes)
   - Implement user authentication for managing phone numbers

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Improve error handling and validation

3. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for production deployment
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy the application to a production server

## Active Decisions

- **Database Choice**: SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and file-based nature, making it easy to set up and use for this project.
- **Frontend Approach**: Using HTMX and Alpine.js to minimize JavaScript while still providing a dynamic user experience.
- **Architecture**: Three-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and testability.

## Open Questions

- What specific phone number segments will be extracted from Côte d'Ivoire numbers (e.g., operator identification, region codes)?
- Will there be any batch processing capabilities in the first version?
- Are there any specific performance requirements for the segmentation process?
- Are there any specific Ivorian telecom regulations that need to be considered?

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Handling edge cases in phone number formats and validation
- Keeping the operator mapping up-to-date with changes in the Ivorian telecom industry
- Optimizing the application for performance and scalability
