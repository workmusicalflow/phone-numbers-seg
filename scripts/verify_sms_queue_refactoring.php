echo "\nSMS Queue Repository Refactoring Verification\n";
echo "===========================================\n\n";

echo "1. Refactoring Summary:\n";
echo "   - Created Doctrine-based SMSQueueRepository\n";
echo "   - Updated SMSQueueRepositoryAdapter to use the Doctrine repository\n";
echo "   - Updated DI configuration to use the Doctrine adapter\n";
echo "\n";

echo "2. Technical Benefits:\n";
echo "   - Consistent repository pattern across the application\n";
echo "   - Leverages Doctrine ORM for better maintainability and type safety\n";
echo "   - Reduces technical debt by unifying the persistence layer\n";
echo "   - Simplifies future enhancements to the SMS queue functionality\n";
echo "\n";

echo "3. Implementation Details:\n";
echo "   - The repository follows the same interface contract\n";
echo "   - All methods from the original PDO implementation have been preserved\n";
echo "   - Error handling and logging are consistent with the project's standard\n";
echo "   - The adapter pattern ensures backward compatibility\n";
echo "\n";

echo "4. Integration:\n";
echo "   - Services using SMSQueueRepositoryInterface will continue to work without changes\n";
echo "   - The DI container is configured to inject the Doctrine implementation\n";
echo "   - No changes required to the SMSQueueService or other dependent services\n";
echo "\n";

echo "5. Next Steps:\n";
echo "   - Consider updating the cron/process_sms_queue.php script to ensure it uses the DI container\n";
echo "   - Add unit tests for the new repository implementation\n";
echo "   - Monitor the performance and make optimizations if needed\n";
echo "\n";

echo "The SMS Queue persistence layer has been successfully refactored to use Doctrine ORM.\n";
echo "This ensures technical consistency with the rest of the project and reduces technical debt.\n";
